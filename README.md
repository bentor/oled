# OLED

This super small OLED driver for Arduino is based on TinyOzOled by Oscar Liang. I added some small fixes and changes to make it run on my setup with the super cheap OLED displays - 0.96" I2C IIC SPI Serial 128X64 White OLED LCD LED Display Module for Arduino.

Among the fixes was to charge pump regulator at init to be able to show anything...

# Intended Use

Copy the OzOLED directory into your Arduino libraries directory to begin using the examples.

Have fun! :)
